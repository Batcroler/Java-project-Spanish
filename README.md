[Login interface and (welcome message) with button that links you to my page.]

The program is only an interface with a login.
I have put a button on the top right wich when you press it close the program.
So in this case i have put that the "User" is (batcroler) and the "Password" is (batcroler1234).
When you press the login botton it takes you to another JFrame wich it contains the message "BIENVENIDO AL PROYECTO BATCROLER".
There's a botton in the bottom part that open your browser with my page.
